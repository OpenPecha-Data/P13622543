Prayer for the Long Life of Pewar Rinpoche
by Katok Rigdzin Chenpo

om swati
Oṃ svasti!
lumé rinchen sum gyi jinlab kyi
Through the blessings of the three unfailing precious Jewels,
chimé ösal nyukmé terdzö ché
May the life of this great Lord, who, through vajra-like samādhi,
tingdzin dorjé tab kyi jepé gön
Opened the great treasury of the natural state, the clear light beyond death,
kutsé yünten shyedön lhündrub shok
Remain forever stable, and may all his wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!

According to the wishes of the supreme lord of refuge, Alak Zenkar Rinpoche, this heartfelt
prayer was made on the excellent occasion of Saga Dawa by the one who holds the name of the
incarnation of Rigdzin Chenpo. May it be a cause for this master’s life to remain secure,
within the nature of the seven vajra qualities, and for his vast waves of enlightened activity
to spread throughout the world.
